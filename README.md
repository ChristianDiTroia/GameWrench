# GameWrench - 2D Game Development Framework

### Description
This is a small project created for my senior capstone project at The University of Scranton. The goal of GameWrench is to provide a user-friendly and approachable development framework for 2-dimensional video games in the hopes of making game development more accessible. Using GameWrench requires no prior game-dev experience, giving those who know basic programming the ability create simple video games with less code, less development time, and no heavy commercial game engines. 

### Tech Stack and Requirements
GameWrench is built in C++20 on top of the SFML library and compiles cross-platform.

Languages: C++20

Depndencies: SFML - https://github.com/SFML

OS: Crossplatform
